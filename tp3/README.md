### Part 2: Drawing of a prism
- With normals perpendicular to each face, the lighting remains uniform within each surface and creates sharp transitions between adjacent faces. This is similar to "Constant Shading", where each face receives a single lighting value without smooth interpolation. As a result, the prism appears faceted with clearly defined edges, unlike techniques like Gouraud that produce smoother transitions between faces.
